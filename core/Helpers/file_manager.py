    The one mechanism every ``atomic_*`` helper below shares. Writes a sibling ``<name>.tmp``, fsyncs

    (MoveFileEx with REPLACE_EXISTING). A reader therefore sees either the whole old file or the whole
    new one, never a truncated mixture. The temp file is a SIBLING, not a file in the system temp dir,
    because os.replace is only atomic within one volume.

    fsync before the rename, not after, is the load-bearing order: the rename can be durable while the
    bytes it points at are still in the page cache, which is exactly how a power cut produces a file
    that exists, has the right size, and is full of zeros.
