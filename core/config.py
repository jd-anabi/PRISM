# === CACHING-ALLOCATOR POLICY ===
# MEASURED 2026-08-28, on the real chi training loop at run_size=2048: this recovers ~6 GiB of usable
# VRAM on a 16 GiB card, and it is the difference between a run that survives and one that wedges.
#
# THE PROBLEM. `n_fine` swings from a median ~40k to a p99 ~283k, so consecutive training batches ask
# the allocator for wildly different large blocks. One big batch carves segments that later small
# batches cannot reuse, and `empty_cache()` can only return a segment that is ENTIRELY free -- a
# single live block pins the whole thing. Measured over 21 batches with PRISM_MEM_LOG_EVERY=1:
#
#     batch   peak allocated   peak reserved   free VRAM
#     b8           8.50 GiB        8.66 GiB     8.14 GiB   <- the big batch carves the segments
#     b14          0.67 GiB        6.39 GiB     8.14 GiB
#     b21          0.37 GiB        6.39 GiB     8.14 GiB   <- 6.39 GiB held to serve 0.37 GiB
#
# The reserved floor never came back down, and free VRAM never recovered past 8.14 GiB. That is what
# left a stuck run holding 15310 MB of a 16303 MB card while every other process on the machine held
# ~270 MB combined -- it was waiting for memory it was sitting on.
#
# THE FIX, and the same 21 batches with it: free VRAM holds at 14.10 GiB for the whole run, and
# reserved tracks the load instead of a floor (b21: 0.73 GiB against 6.39). `roundup_power2_divisions`
# collapses that continuum of block sizes onto a handful, so segments are reusable across batches;
# `garbage_collection_threshold` makes the allocator reclaim proactively rather than only when an
# allocation is already failing.
#
# ⚠ THE VARIABLE NAME IS A TRAP, and the deprecation warning is wrong on this build (torch
# 2.9.0+cu130). `PYTORCH_ALLOC_CONF` -- the name torch TELLS you to use -- is SILENTLY IGNORED here:
# an unrecognised option inside it raises nothing at all. `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF` is the one that
# is actually parsed (an unrecognised option raises `Unrecognized CachingAllocator option`), while
# printing "PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF is deprecated, use PYTORCH_ALLOC_CONF instead". Verify with an
# invalid value before believing any future experiment on either name; an hour was lost to a
# "negative result" that was really a no-op.
#
# NOT `expandable_segments`, which would be the ideal fix and is a measured no-op on this Windows
# build (measured): it needs CUDA's VMM API, which cu130-on-Windows does not
# expose. These two options are pure allocator POLICY and are not platform-gated.
#
# SET HERE rather than in run.bat so the CLI, the scripts and the tests get it too. Safe this late:
# the config is parsed at the FIRST CUDA ALLOCATION, not at `import torch` -- verified by setting an
# invalid value after importing torch and watching it still raise. `setdefault`, so anything the
# operator exports wins.

# --- SBC calibration batching -------------------------------------------------------------------
# These two are INDEPENDENT knobs and it matters which one you turn.
#
# The SDE solver is a kernel-launch-bound sequential time loop, so a batch of 10 and a batch of 256
# cost the SAME wall-clock. Calibration cost is therefore driven by the NUMBER OF BATCHES, not the
# number of samples:   sim cost  ~  CAL_N_SCALES x (1 + K in chi mode)
#                      samples   =  CAL_N_SCALES x cal_run_size      (run_size is nearly free)
#                      SBC cost  ~  n_cal                            (run_sbc draws + check_sbc C2ST)
#
# CAL_N_SCALES is also the (t_scale, T) DIVERSITY count: gen_training_data draws one Sobol pair per
# batch and OVERRIDES t_scale to it for every row, so all rows in a batch share one t_scale truth and
# their SBC ranks are not independent. t_scale's effective sample size is CAL_N_SCALES, NOT n_cal.
# Lowering it buys wall-clock at the direct expense of the parameter chi(omega) mode exists to pin.
#
# Defaults below reproduce the historical behaviour EXACTLY at SBC_N_CAL=2000 (200 pairs x 10), so
# results stay comparable with the keeper posterior's K=10 x n_cal=2000 characterization. To spend
# the free GPU capacity, raise SBC_N_CAL and leave CAL_N_SCALES alone (200 x 64 = 12800 samples costs
# the same simulation time as today, only more downstream SBC). To make a chi-mode validate tractable
# -- it pays CAL_N_SCALES x (K+1) simulations, ~7x at K=6 -- lower CAL_N_SCALES and say so in the
# write-up, because that is a different measurement, not a faster one.

                       # the K=10 repeat study (`python -m core sbc --repeats 10`) showed mild marginal
                       # miscalibration only surfaces reliably at n_cal>=2000 (KS power grows with n_cal).

# --- Training-data checkpointing ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Write a resumable checkpoint every N training batches; 0 disables it entirely.
#
# Deliberately NOT sharing pipeline._MEM_LOG_EVERY (250). That one is a DISPLAY volume, tuned to give
# ~21 [mem] lines over a 5000-batch run; tying durability to it means a later decision to log less
# often silently multiplies the crash-loss window. Two meanings, two knobs.
#
# The cost model at 5000 x 2048 rows, chi width 114 (+13 latent targets), i.e. the retrain's shape:
#     per checkpoint   50 x 2048 x 127 x 4 B          ~=  52 MB written, well under 1 s on NVMe
#     overhead         against 50 batches x ~20 s     ~=  under 0.1 % of wall-clock
#     expected loss    half an interval on a crash    ~=  8 minutes of simulation
#     whole run        100 checkpoints                ~=  4.9 GiB on disk
# Anything from 25 to 100 is defensible; 50 sits in the flat part of both curves. Checkpointing every
# batch is 100x the write volume to buy back 8 minutes on a multi-day run, which is not a trade.
TRAINING_CHECKPOINT_EVERY = 50

# --- Batch-level OOM retry (2026-08-27) --------------------------------------------------------
# The LAST line of defence, below _gen_obs_retry (halves the simulator batch) and _rows_with_oom_retry
# (halves the training batch's rows). Both of those shrink the work; this one instead WAITS and runs
# the same batch again, because the failure they cannot fix is the one where the card is simply full
# of somebody else's surfaces right now -- a browser opening a video, a game launcher waking up. That
# is transient by nature and the correct response is a pause, not a smaller batch.
#
# The re-run is EXACT: gen_training_data restores the batch's opening RNG snapshot first, so the
# retried batch is the batch that would have been produced. See the retry loop for why that matters
# to the checkpoint rather than merely being tidy.
#
# 0 attempts disables it and restores the pre-2026-08-27 behaviour (fail as soon as both halving
# ladders are exhausted).
TRAINING_BATCH_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3
# Seconds to wait before each retry. Escalating, because a desktop that is busy now is usually busy
# for seconds-to-minutes: 15 s catches a transient, 3 min catches a browser finishing a page load.
# Longer than the last entry is not worth it -- at that point the card is genuinely committed
# elsewhere and a human should decide, which is what the failure lets them do. The list is indexed by
# attempt and the last value repeats if ATTEMPTS exceeds its length.
TRAINING_BATCH_RETRY_DELAYS_S = (15.0, 60.0, 180.0)

TRAINING_RUN_SIZE = 0   # CEILING on simulations per training batch; 0 = follow DeviceConfig.batch_size.
                        #
                        # DEFAULTS TO OFF, and should normally stay off. Batch width is nearly free in
                        # wall-clock -- the SDE solver is a kernel-launch-bound sequential time loop, so
                        # a batch costs about the same whatever its width (measured on a 5070 Ti at
                        # n_fine=100k: 7.37 s at 2048 against 7.74 s at 1024, i.e. the SMALLER batch is
                        # slightly slower). Lowering this therefore does NOT speed anything up; it trades
                        # training rows for peak VRAM at roughly 1:1, and TRAINING_NUM_RUNS has to rise to
                        # compensate, which DOES cost wall-clock proportionally.
                        #
                        # It is an ESCAPE HATCH, not the memory fix. The memory fix is per-geometry: a
                        # training batch's cost is width x n_fine, and n_fine swings from a median ~40k to
                        # a p99 ~283k, so at a fixed width the tail is ~7x the median. pipeline's
                        # _max_sim_batch already sizes each batch against its OWN geometry, and its
                        # learned budget plus _gen_obs_retry handle the tail by SPLITTING -- which costs
                        # k x wall-clock on the few percent of batches that need it rather than on all of
                        # them. Reach for this only if the retry notices show splitting on a large

                        # as an error. The asymmetry is principled: the prior sweep is iteration-bounded,
                        # so a LARGER batch there is free accuracy and worth allowing; training is never
                        # helped by a batch wider than the hardware default, since that is the thing that

# === PROGRESS BARS ===
# The per-time-segment bar (core/Simulator/simulator.py) wraps segs in {1,2,3} -- a three-step bar that
# tells a user nothing, while nesting a whole extra level under the training-data bar.
# core.gui.app.build_app() sets this True; the command-line tool never touches it and keeps both
# bars.
# Read this through the MODULE (`from core import config; config.QUIET_SEGMENT_BAR`) -- a
# `from core.config import QUIET_SEGMENT_BAR` snapshots the value at import and would freeze it False.
QUIET_SEGMENT_BAR = False

# The SDE solver's per-step bar (core/Solvers/sdeint.py) is f"{SOLVER_BAR_DESC} (batch={batch_size})".
# The GUI finds it by this desc prefix -- keyed on the DESC, never on the row, because the bar's tqdm
# `pos` is 0, 1 or 2 depending on which phase and which panel is running.
#
# WHAT THE GUI DOES WITH IT: exclude it, and only that. Its total is in the tens of thousands, so it
# would win the overall bar's election every time and sweep it 0->100% every second. It is
# NOT the "Solver Performance" meter's source any more -- that number comes from core.progress.SOLVER,
# because a solver call shorter than its own bar's mininterval never paints a rate at all, which is
# exactly what CUDA graphs made happen.
#
# The bar nevertheless stays ENABLED under the GUI, unlike QUIET_SEGMENT_BAR above: its redraws are the
# cooperative cancel's most frequent checkpoint and feed the stall detector's heartbeat through a long
# batch. See core/gui/widgets/progress_pane.py.

# === DECORRELATING REPARAMETERIZATION (flow calibration via latent rotation) ===
# When the inferred params are well-identified but strongly correlated (e.g. kappa~x_scale at
# |cos|=0.95), the flow mis-calibrates the thin diagonal ridge. Rotating the flow's latent
# coordinate into the simulation-based Fisher eigenbasis makes that posterior axis-aligned so the
# flow can calibrate it -- no information loss, no model/stats change. REPARAM_ROTATE=False (V=I)
# is exactly the current pipeline, so the rotation is fully optional and model-agnostic.
REPARAM_ROTATE = True   # True = rotate into the Fisher eigenbasis; False = plain pipeline.

# Operating points (GT + prior draws) over which the simulation Fisher is AVERAGED to build the
# rotation V. >1 makes the single linear rotation valid prior-wide, not just at GT (a GT-only V
# re-correlates the curved degeneracies off-GT). 1 = GT-only (the original behavior).
REPARAM_FISHER_POINTS = 8

# === LOG-SPACE BOX (linearize the multiplicative degeneracies before rotating) ===
# ND/rescale params (by cell-file key) whose box bijection is GEOMETRIC (log) instead of linear.
# In log coords the products kappa*x_scale (amplitude) and lambda*t_scale (timescale) become SUMS,
# so the single linear Fisher rotation can decorrelate them across the whole prior. Only params with
# a strictly positive lower bound are eligible (others fall back to linear with a warning). Empty
# list = pure linear box (legacy). The chosen mask is persisted beside each posterior (<name>.rot.pt)
# so eval reconstructs the exact training box regardless of this setting. REBUILD the ND prior after
# changing this (the latent GMM is fit in the box's coordinate).
REPARAM_LOG_PARAMS = []   # ALL-LINEAR box (the keeper posterior_07012026's coordinate). Log-scaling
                          # f_scale (REPARAM_LOG_PARAMS=["f_scale"]) was TRIED as a fix for its mild
                          # linear-box SBC tilt (GT=10 at box-fraction 0.009 = flat sigmoid tail; see
                          # archive/scripts/diagnose_fscale.py), but the posterior trained under it was WORSE --
                          # bad TARP / expected-coverage and a worse f_scale SBC rank -- so it was
                          # discarded and this was reverted to []. Keep the DEGENERACY params
                          # (k, lam, x_scale, t_scale) LINEAR too (log OVER-MIXED those in posterior_6302026).
                          # f_scale is a RESCALE param, so toggling it here does NOT rebuild the ND prior:
                          # nd_log_mask stays all-False, and the existing linear ND prior
                          # (prior_forcing_no_forcing.pt) + posterior_07012026 already match this box.

# reached -1.7e29 -- three decades of outlier under the threshold, which is what dragged its fitted
# std to 4.19e11.
#   ⚠ THE SUMMARY BLOCK ONLY, NEVER THE CHI BLOCK. A pad slot is exactly 0.0 in all six channels and
#   is required to be BITWISE inert (pinned by tests/test_chi_set_encoder.py). Clipping a probe column whose 0.1th
#   percentile is non-zero would move that 0.0 and silently turn every pad into a phantom probe.

# second pathway (forcing_dim = 3K). A single passive trace only sees the products D*A_nd (amplitude)
# and (lambda_hb/k_gs)*tau_nd (timescale); the chi(omega) SHAPE over frequency separates
# kappa/lambda/x_scale/t_scale INDIVIDUALLY -- the only lever on the information ceiling + the

# === chi(omega) SET CONDITIONING (layout 2) ===
# The chi block is a PADDED SET of probes, not a fixed 3K grid. Probe j occupies pad slot j as six

# channel 0 rather than being implied by its slot index. That is the whole point: the number of
# probes and where they sit in frequency both become free, so a bench session that achieved 7
# recordings at whatever frequencies it could manage conditions the same trained network as a
# simulated 12-probe sweep.
#
# CHI_K_PAD IS FROZEN INTO EVERY ARTIFACT. sbi's reshape_to_batch_event bakes condition_shape into the
# saved posterior, so raising it later invalidates every chi posterior -- which is why the sidecar
# records it and the load path refuses a mismatch (a message, not a shape assert hours into a run).

# different question from how the manifold was mapped. Both were hardcoded in
