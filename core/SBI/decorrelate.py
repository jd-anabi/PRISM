"""
Simulation-based Fisher eigenbasis for the decorrelating reparameterization.

V = eigenvectors of the latent Fisher F = J^T J, where J is the standardized feature-Jacobian
w.r.t. the flow's latent coordinate z at the ground-truth operating point (perturb z -> T(z) ->
simulate -> features). Rotating the flow's coordinate by V decorrelates the (near-degenerate)
posterior so the flow can calibrate it.

The Jacobian is built over THE FEATURES THE POSTERIOR ACTUALLY CONDITIONS ON, which differ by
observation mode:
    spontaneous  41 features (Groups A-F; Group G is zero-padded and contributes zero rows)
    forced       41 features (Group G populated by the drive response)
    chi          41 + 3K -- Groups A-F (Group G zeroed) plus the chi FISHER block, which is
                 CHI_FISHER_CHANNELS (log|chi|, cos, sin) per probe -- NOT the 6-channel
                 conditioning block, and no longer the 4-channel set that included logcyc (every
                 logcyc row was a duplicate of A3_log_fpeak or floor() quantization, never
                 independent information)
Getting that wrong is silent: a Fisher built over the single-frequency feature set describes a
different experiment than the one being run, so V would decorrelate the wrong thing.

No trained posterior is needed -- F comes from the simulator alone, so this generalizes to any
model. V = I (REPARAM_ROTATE=False) recovers the plain pipeline exactly. Orthogonality, the
bijection round-trip and the rotation reuse are pinned by tests/test_user_sbi.py's Fisher tests,
and `python -m core smoke` exercises the rotation end to end on the card.
