        :param merge_layer_dim: hidden layer dim for the merge pathway
        :param chi_k_pad: chi SET mode. The trailing block is a PADDED PROBE SET of ``chi_k_pad``
            slots, so the forcing pathway becomes a permutation-invariant ChiSetEncoder and this
            module takes over standardization of the WHOLE conditioning vector (see below).
            None = the original dense pathway, byte-unchanged.
        :param chi_band: (lo, hi) chi frequency bounds; fixes the encoder's frequency normalization.

        WHY CHI OWNS ITS STANDARDIZATION. sbi's ``posterior_nn(z_score_x=...)`` defaults to
        ``"independent"``, a PER-COLUMN affine over the whole conditioning vector. Over probe-slot
        columns that is inherently permutation-BREAKING -- two orderings of one probe set would be
        scaled differently, destroying the invariance the encoder exists to provide -- and the
        near-constant mask column becomes a ~1e7 amplifier under sbi's 1e-7 min-std clamp. So chi
        trains with ``z_score_x="none"`` and standardizes here instead: per-channel inside the
        encoder, and RANK-GAUSSIANISED for the summary block, both fitted over real data only.

        WHY RANK-GAUSSIANISATION AND NOT MEAN/STD. The affine this replaces
        was measured on the 2026-08-25 retrain's own artifact: ``A1_mean`` was fitted at
        std = 4.19e11 against a physical range of ~1e3, and ``D3_bimodality`` at std = 4.42e8
        against a range of (0, 1]. Both were driven there by a handful of pathological trajectories
        -- huge-magnitude traces under the old 1e15 guard for ``A1_mean``, exactly-constant ones for
        ``D3_bimodality`` (which make ``_group_d``'s clamp fire and return exactly 1/1e-12). The
        consequence is that sweeping either channel across its ENTIRE physical range moved the
        embedding by 1.8e-7 / 8.9e-8, against ~1.4 for a healthy channel: less than one float32 ulp,
        i.e. the flow could not see two of its own conditioning channels at all.

        Rank-Gaussianisation fixes that by construction and buys three more things:

        * it is MONOTONE and invertible, so no information is lost;
        * being invariant to any monotone transform, it settles the log-versus-linear question for
          every channel at once (see REPARAM_LOG_PARAMS' history);
        * a sentinel point mass becomes a point mass at a KNOWN quantile the flow can key on, rather
          than a scale factor -- which matters because a large fraction of several ``_logp`` channels
          sits on exactly ``log(1e-12)``.

        LOADING AN OLDER POSTERIOR. A posterior trained before this change is a pickled
        DirectPosterior holding an EmbeddedNet whose buffers are ``sum_mean``/``sum_std``.
        Unpickling restores THOSE buffers into an instance of THIS class, so ``forward`` dispatches
        on which buffers are present rather than assuming the new ones. Without that branch every
        pre-2026-08-26 artifact becomes unloadable.
