    carries the physical scale magnitude (like Group-G's gain); its SHAPE over omega carries the ND

    :param t_fine: (T_full,) fine ND time grid the drive/sim use.
    :param inits: (B, n_vars) initial conditions.
    :param subsample: fine->dt_exp downsample factor. A scalar int (uniform t_scale: training batches,
                      a single GT) OR a (B,) per-sample tensor (posterior samples in PPC, whose t_scale
                      differs per sample); applied via gather so both cases share one code path.
    :param multipliers: (K,) or (B, K). Relative multipliers of each row's own measured Omega_0, or --
                        with ``absolute_freqs`` -- frequencies in cell freq units. ABSOLUTE is what the
                        experimental path and the PPC use: the experiment fixed the drive frequencies,

                        simulate a different experiment and make the PPC agree for the wrong reason.

                              False for the Fisher.** The filter depends on f_peak, which depends on

                              of a central difference -- a step of 1 divided by fnoise's 1e-9 floor
                              puts ~1e9 into the Jacobian, and V becomes that discontinuity.
    :param duration_frac: (K,) fractions of N_points to lock each probe in over. None = full length.
    :param max_cycles: CEILING on the drive cycles each probe is locked in over; None reads
                       ``config.CHI_MAX_CYCLES``, ``math.inf`` disables it. Applied AFTER
                       ``duration_frac``, so it is a ceiling on that draw rather than a replacement.
                       This is not a filter -- nothing is masked or dropped, the SEGMENT is shortened
                       -- which is why it lives here rather than in a caller: training, the Fisher
                       rotation, the PPC and the experimental path must all measure the same
                       observable, and a ceiling applied in only one of them is silent. See
                       config.CHI_MAX_CYCLES for the measurement behind it.
    :param adapt_placement: lift each ROW's multipliers into the sub-band its own Omega_0 can resolve
                            (:func:`core.SBI.chi.resolvable_multipliers`). **TRAINING ONLY.** The
                            experimental path drove at frequencies the experiment chose and the PPC
                            must reproduce the observation's, so both pass ``absolute_freqs`` and are
                            never adapted -- moving a probe there would answer a different experiment
                            than the one that was run. Ignored when ``absolute_freqs`` is set.
