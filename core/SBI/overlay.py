"""Machinery for comparing posterior-predictive traces against the observation.

WHY THIS EXISTS. For spontaneous dynamics the oscillation PHASE is set by the noise realisation, not by
theta: simulating the exact ground truth still yields a different phase. So a posterior draw can never
line up with the observation pointwise, and pointwise-averaging draws is worse than useless (different
phases cancel, leaving a flat line at the mean level -- which is why the eye test simulates central
PARAMETERS rather than averaging trajectories). What genuinely can agree is frequency, amplitude, mean
and waveform shape. This module therefore provides:

  * explicit PHASE ALIGNMENT by FFT cross-correlation, so a draw can be laid over the observation;
  * TWO best-fit rankings, which answer different questions:
      - by SUMMARY STATISTICS: closest in the space the posterior actually conditioned on (the
        statistically principled pick), free because those statistics are already computed for the PPC;
      - by TRACE (after alignment): closest in waveform, i.e. the draw that literally looks most like
        the observation -- the right pick for an eye test. Aligning FIRST is essential; raw trace L2 is
        dominated by phase offset, which carries no parameter information here;
  * two PHASE-INVARIANT summaries -- a PSD band and a cycle-averaged waveform -- which compare the
    things that should agree without any alignment step to argue about.

Everything is batched torch and float64 internally (lock-in-style sums over long records).
