"""Multi-frequency susceptibility chi(omega) features for the SBI pipeline (CHI_MODE).

Pure math helpers only -- NO simulation and NO dependency on core.SBI.pipeline (the K single-tone
forced runs live in pipeline.gen_chi_block, which owns gen_obs / build_nondim_sin_force_tensor). This
module supplies: the relative-frequency grid, a batched spontaneous peak-frequency estimator, a
batched lock-in, the [log|chi|, cos, sin] feature packing, and the feature labels.

chi(omega) generalizes the single-frequency Group-G lock-in (statistics.SummaryStatistics._group_g)
to a K-frequency CURVE. The drive is K single-tone recordings at omega_k = mult_k * Omega_0, with the
multipliers log-spaced over config.CHI_FREQ_BOUNDS and Omega_0 the measured spontaneous peak (so the
resonance sits in a canonical frame regardless of where t_scale puts it -- mirrors the FDT pipeline's
data-driven grid). See config.CHI_MODE for the full rationale.

Unit convention (matches the forced path + core/FDT/spectral.lock_in_chi): chi is measured on the
REDIMENSIONALIZED response x_dim with the DIMENSIONAL drive amplitude F0, so chi = response/drive
carries the physical x_scale/f_scale magnitude (like Group-G's gain), while its SHAPE over omega
carries the ND resonance (kappa/lambda/...). Frequencies are in cell frequency units; times in cell
time units (dt_exp). Accumulations are done in float64 (long low-omega lock-in sums), then cast back.

#   FISHER        3 channels x K probes     -> decorrelate.feats, `identifiability jacobian`
#   (the labels in core/diagnostics/feature_sets.py are the FISHER set minus the 11 Group-G columns)
#
# `u`, `mask` and `logcyc` are deliberately ABSENT from the Fisher set. The reason is one property with
# three faces: a standardized Jacobian DIVIDES by an ensemble std (`fnoise = max(std, 1e-9)`), so a
# channel that barely varies with theta is an AMPLIFIER, not a quiet row. Note the asymmetry that makes
# this so hard to see -- an EXACTLY constant channel is harmless (0/1e-9 = 0, which is why chi mode's
# 11 zeroed Group-G columns cost nothing), while a NEARLY constant one writes order-1-to-1e4 entries
# into the matrix that defines the flow's coordinate system, with V still orthogonal to 1e-4 and every
# test passing.
#
#   `u = log(f_k/f_peak)` is theta-INDEPENDENT wherever the Fisher probes a deterministic multiplier
#   grid: across an ensemble it is log(mult_k) plus one float32 multiply-and-divide of rounding, std
#   ~2.5e-8. (That is 25x ABOVE the 1e-9 clamp, so the clamp protects nothing -- any guard for this
#   has to be RELATIVE to the channel's own magnitude.)
#
#   `mask` is theta-dependent but DISCONTINUOUS -- a step of 1 over the same floor. See trap CHI2.
#
#   `logcyc` was kept here until 2026-08-10 on the grounds that it "genuinely varies with theta through
#   f_peak". True, and insufficient: it varies EXACTLY as a row already in the feature set does. With
#   the ceiling clear, logcyc_j = log(mult_j) + log(f_peak) + log(T_obs), whose first and third terms
#   are constants that vanish under standardization -- so the standardized row IS `A3_log_fpeak`'s, and
#   K probes contribute K exact duplicates that weight that one direction K-fold in J^T J. Measured on
#   a real rotation: four of six rows agreed to 6 significant figures. With the ceiling BINDING,
#   freq*T_row -> CHI_MAX_CYCLES and all that remains is the sawtooth of floor(), std ~1e-4 -- the
#   amplifier case, measured at max|J| = 2.0e4 against 289 for the largest real feature in the
#   jacobian diagnostic, and at a harmless 6.0 in a rotation whose +-dz arms happened not to
#   straddle a quantization step. Intermittent, not benign: a rotation averages 8 operating points over
#   a ~4-decade Omega_0 prior. Duplicate or quantization, never independent -- so it leaves.
#
# This is about the FISHER set ONLY. In the CONDITIONING block `logcyc` is genuinely informative,
# because training varies placement AND duration per row, so the constants above are not
# constant there. Do not "simplify" the two lists toward each other.

    """Lift each ROW's multipliers into the sub-band its own Omega_0 can actually resolve -> (B, K).

    THE PROBLEM, measured. Probes sit at ``mult * Omega_0``, so
    a probe resolves only if ``mult * Omega_0 * T >= CHI_MIN_CYCLES``. The prior spans ~4 decades of
    Omega_0 while the band is a FIXED window of multipliers, so with one shared multiplier set the
    slow rows cannot resolve at any placement in the band: measured, 55 % of training rows carried
    ZERO live probes, going 0 % live below 3 Hz to 98 % above 30 Hz. Those rows are genuine
    oscillators (spectral prominence in the thousands), so masking them is correct -- the fix is to
    stop ASKING them for probes they cannot deliver.

    WHAT THIS DOES. Per row, the usable sub-band is ``[max(lo, min_cycles/(f*T)), hi]``. The drawn
    multipliers are mapped onto it by an affine transform in LOG space, which preserves their
    ordering, their relative spacing and the stratified jitter that
    :func:`sample_multipliers` produced -- the placement is compressed, not redrawn. Costs nothing:
    the frequencies were already per-row (``freqs = mults * f_peak`` is ``(B, K)``, each row driven
    at its own frequency) and only the multipliers were shared, so this changes no simulation count.

    WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, and this must be stated wherever the result is used: a slow row ends up
    probed near the band's TOP, so it gains resolution but loses frequency SPREAD -- and spread is
    what chi(omega) exists to measure. This converts inert rows into weakly-informative ones, not
    into good ones. A row too slow even for the band's top edge (``lo_row >= hi``) is left at ``hi``
    and will still be masked; that is the honest outcome, not a failure of this function.

    ONLY the floor is a placement bound. ``max_cycles`` is deliberately NOT one, and the reason is
    arithmetic: the band's dynamic range (``hi/lo`` = 10 at the configured band) is exactly the cycle
    window's (``CHI_MAX_CYCLES/CHI_MIN_CYCLES`` = 10), so requiring a row to satisfy both leaves it a
    single feasible multiplier for all but one value of ``Omega_0 * T`` -- every probe on one
    frequency, resolving perfectly and measuring no SHAPE at all. Tried, and reverted for that reason.
    The asymmetry that decides it: falling under the floor MASKS a probe outright, while exceeding the
    ceiling only makes it noisier, and gen_chi_raw's duration ceiling still truncates it afterwards.
    A hard bound belongs on the failure that loses the probe, not on the one that degrades it.

    *That leaves a known limit, and it is not this function's to fix:* the duration ceiling is keyed
    on the batch's FASTEST row, so a slow row it just rescued can still be truncated back under the
    floor. Measured, that holds the rescue to ~47 % live. The real fix is a per-ROW lock-in duration
    (``lock_in_batched`` takes a scalar ``T_obs`` today), which is a change to the estimator itself.

    NEVER leaves the band: every returned multiplier is within ``[lo, hi]``, so ``|u_hat| <= 1`` and
    the packer's CHI_UHAT_MAX filter cannot fire on placement alone.

    product); chunking drops that to 64 bytes per (B, chunk) element, which at the training batch
    size is the difference between ~10 GB and ~0.2 GB. Results agree with the naive form to float64
    round-off; see tests/test_user_sbi.py::test_lock_in_chunking_matches_full_batch.

    TWO INVARIANTS, both of which fail SILENTLY (finite, in-range, wrong):
      * the mean is over the trace ACTUALLY LOCKED IN, computed in pass 1. Demeaning per chunk would
        be a high-pass filter with corner ~1/(chunk*dt), which preferentially eats the LOW-multiplier
        probes -- and CHI_FREQ_BOUNDS is entirely SUB-RESONANCE, so EVERY probe is a low-multiplier
        one. Under ``n_samples`` this means the mean is over each row's OWN prefix: taking it over the
        full width instead would subtract a level the row's samples never had, and the residual would
        land at DC where a low-frequency lock-in is most sensitive to it.
      * the phase in a chunk starting at s uses the ABSOLUTE times arange(s, e)*dt, never
        arange(0, e-s)*dt. (The wrong form is normally an order-unity error, but it is invisible when
        omega*chunk*dt happens to be a multiple of 2*pi -- so test with incommensurate omega.)

    :param x: (B, n) response traces (physical), sampled at dt.
    :param omega: (B,) drive ANGULAR frequencies (cell freq units, rad/cell-time).
    :param F0: drive amplitude the response was driven with -- a scalar OR a (B,) per-sample tensor
               (chi is drive-amplitude-independent in the linear regime, but F0 must MATCH the drive
               so the units are physical).
    :param T_obs: observation duration covered by the trace, cell time units. Scalar, or (B,) to go
                  with a per-row ``n_samples``.
    :param dt: sampling interval (scalar, cell time units).
    :param chunk: time-chunk length. Memory only -- numerically irrelevant.
    :param n_samples: (B,) leading sample count per row, or None for "all n". This is what lets ONE
                      batched call lock in rows over DIFFERENT durations, which chi mode needs
                      because Omega_0 spans ~4 decades within a training batch: a single shared
                      duration must be keyed on the fastest row to respect CHI_MAX_CYCLES, and that
                      truncates the slow rows below CHI_MIN_CYCLES and masks them (~48 % of rows
                      carried no live probe under the shared duration). Rows are MASKED rather than
                      sliced -- the tensor stays rectangular, so the chunked float64 accumulation is
                      unchanged and the memory bound grows by one BOOL mask per chunk: +16 MiB at
                      B=2048, chunk=8192, against a 553.7 MiB unmasked peak. (The per-row change
                      first claimed "unchanged" and shipped a float64 mask, +128 MiB. See _mask.)

    THREE properties the rest of the design leans on:

    * **A failed probe is MASKED, never a phantom.** The old packer ran nan_to_num over the whole
      block, so a non-finite lock-in became a live-looking (0, 0, 0) triple -- and cos^2+sin^2 = 1
      says no real probe can produce that. Here `mask` is the single verdict: simulated AND finite
      AND resolvable AND in band.
    * **Pads are EXACTLY 0.0 in all six channels.** Deterministic, so every downstream constant-column
      filter (posterior_predictive_check's s_std > 1e-10, overlay.rank_by_stats) drops them; and
      finite, so train_nn's isfinite/|x|<1e15 filter and gen_cal_data's validity mask drop ZERO rows.
      Never torch.empty, never NaN.
    * **Valid probes are packed contiguously into slots 0..n-1, ascending in frequency.** The encoder
      is provably slot-invariant so this is free for learning, but it makes the layout deterministic
      across generate_observations / gen_training_data / the PPC / the experimental path, which is
      what lets a test compare them byte-for-byte.

    Raises rather than truncating when K > k_pad: silently dropping probes the caller paid to
    simulate is the kind of attrition that shows up as a mysteriously uninformative posterior.
