# WHY A LEARNED CAP EXISTS AT ALL: on Windows, the free-memory reading is a lie, and it is the input
# _max_sim_batch plans from. config.memory_budget_elements reads torch.cuda.mem_get_info(), and under
# WDDM the OS virtualises VRAM -- other processes' surfaces are EVICTABLE, so the driver reports them
# to you as free. Measured at one instant on a 16 GB RTX 5070 Ti with an ordinary desktop running
# (2026-08-10): mem_get_info said 15037 MiB free while nvidia-smi said 5814 MiB. Optimistic by 9.2 GiB,
# which is exactly the desktop.
#
# The planner then green-lights a batch the driver can only satisfy by EVICTING the browser, and
# returns cudaErrorMemoryAllocation only when eviction cannot keep up -- which is why that failure
# arrives as a raw driver AcceleratorError rather than torch.OutOfMemoryError, and why it lands hours
# into a run rather than immediately. No amount of tuning _SIM_MEM_FRACTION fixes a wrong input.
#
# So: stop treating the reading as authoritative and learn the real ceiling from OUTCOMES. AIMD, on
# the budget in ELEMENTS rather than on the batch width -- width is the wrong variable, because
# whether a batch fits is width x GEOMETRY and _max_sim_batch already handles geometry correctly (a
# 2048-row batch at n_fine=40k fits comfortably; the same width at 283k does not). Adapting width
# would fight the planner and oscillate; adapting its budget composes with it.

    ``plans`` and ``graphs`` select the two resources that live OUTSIDE the caching allocator, and
    they default to on because the callers that matter are RECOVERY paths. Turn them off in a hot
    loop -- see "NOT EVERY CALLER WANTS ALL THREE" below.

    WHY THE GUARD EXISTS. On 2026-08-27 the retrain died at batch 351/5000 with a raw
    ``AcceleratorError: CUDA error: out of memory`` raised BY ``torch.cuda.empty_cache()`` inside
    _rows_with_oom_retry -- the OOM was caught correctly and the run was killed by its own recovery.
    A release that cannot free anything is INFORMATION, not a reason to abandon a multi-day run.
    And because the release sits OUTSIDE the ``except`` block (see below), Python has already
    cleared the exception context -- the secondary failure arrives with ``__context__`` None and a
    traceback saying nothing about the OOM that started it, which is the traceback that crash
    produced.

    ``except Exception``, NEVER ``BaseException``: streams.WorkerCancelled derives from BaseException
    precisely so a cooperative cancel sails through handlers like this one to reach Worker.run.

    THREE RESOURCES, THREE SEPARATE GUARDS, because they fail independently and each is worth having
    even if the others could not run:
      * the caching allocator's cached-but-unused segments (``empty_cache``);
      * the cuFFT plan cache, which lives OUTSIDE that allocator so empty_cache cannot touch it --
        ~2 MB per distinct transform shape, ~7 new signatures per training batch, zero cross-batch
        reuse (the 2026-07-28 leak);
      * the captured CUDA graphs, whose memory lives in PRIVATE pools that empty_cache also cannot
        reclaim. At an OOM up to SOLVER_GRAPH_CACHE_MAX of them are pinned and the halving retry is
        about to capture ANOTHER at the reduced width, since the batch shape is part of the graph
        key. Dropping them is the one release that addresses the retry's own next allocation.

    CALL IT OUTSIDE THE ``except`` BLOCK, always. While the caught error is still bound its traceback
    owns the frames of the failed attempt, which own their tensors -- the solver's (n_vars, batch, T)
    buffer among them -- so releasing there frees nothing. Python drops the error when the clause
    ends; only then is this worth asking for.

    NOT EVERY CALLER WANTS ALL THREE, and the defaults are tuned for the recovery paths:
      * a hot loop (gen_stats' sub-batches, gen_chi_raw's probes) passes ``plans=False,
        graphs=False``. Clearing the plan cache there would destroy the INTRA-batch cuFFT reuse
        those loops exist to get, and dropping graphs would force a recapture per probe -- against
        a solver whose graph replay is an ~8x speedup, that is a large regression bought for
        nothing, because a loop that is not failing is not short of memory.
      * gen_training_data's per-batch tail passes ``graphs=False`` for the same reason but keeps
        ``plans=True``: N_points_k changes every batch so cross-batch plan reuse is exactly zero,
        and the cache would otherwise saturate mid-run.
      * the OOM retries take the default, all three, because the card is provably short and the
        retry's own next allocation is a graph capture at the halved width.

    Restoring before a retry makes the re-run reproduce the batch exactly; NOT restoring makes it a
    different but equally valid iid draw -- the same licence _rows_with_oom_retry already takes when
    it re-draws SDE noise in smaller blocks. It does NOT desynchronise the checkpoint, because the
    checkpoint always stores the ACTUAL state at a batch boundary (the cadence write snapshots
    fresh, the rescue write uses that batch's own opening snapshot), and rows already on disk are
    never regenerated. Seed-level reproducibility is out of reach here anyway: the inits come from
    numpy's global RNG, which torch seeds do not touch.

    Public for the same reason as `peak_sim_elements`: a front-end showing "will this fit?" must
    compare against the planner's budget, not against a raw `mem_get_info` reading. ⚠ That reading
    still overstates free VRAM on Windows by roughly the size of the desktop (measured 15037 MiB
    against nvidia-smi's 5814), which is why the learned cap exists -- so treat anything derived from
    this as an UPPER bound on what is really available.

    THREE TERMS, AND EACH ANSWERS A DIFFERENT QUESTION. The reading says what the driver claims is
    free (optimistic). The LEARNED cap says what has actually failed (reactive -- it can only know
    after something died). The CEILING says what the OPERATOR knows in advance: on a day the desktop
    will be busy, it makes the planner split from batch 0 rather than discover the ceiling hours in.
    Read live off the module, never imported: ``from .config import NAME`` binds at import, so an
    importer would never see a per-run assignment to config.SIM_VRAM_CEILING_GIB.

    ⚠ THE CEILING NEEDS HEADROOM TO CAP TO, and it is not a substitute for freeing VRAM. On a card
    with 115 MiB actually free it changes nothing: _max_sim_batch finds that not even a floor-sized
    chunk fits alongside the result and runs the batch as asked. What it buys is stopping a run that
    HAS headroom from silently spilling into WDDM's shared-memory pool, where a batch does not fail
    -- it pages, at up to a 9x wall-clock penalty (measured 2026-08-27: 21.67 GiB completed on this
    15.92 GiB card). Free the memory first, then set this to about (nvidia-smi free) - 1 GiB.

    ``PRISM_VRAM_CEILING_GIB`` overrides the config constant, so a single run can be throttled

    THE COMPANION TO _max_sim_batch, NOT A REPLACEMENT. That guard is PREDICTIVE, and on a shared card
    a prediction cannot be made reliable: it budgets from a free-memory reading that Windows overstates
    by the size of the desktop (see the learned-budget block above), and even where the reading is
    honest it is stale by the time the allocation lands. So the plan is a HINT and this is the
    MECHANISM: fail, shed half the rows, try again. _max_sim_batch's job shrinks to keeping the common
    case off this path, and _budget_note_oom's job is to make sure the next plan is wiser.

    Splitting here is licensed by exactly the argument gen_obs already makes for the predictive split:
    rows are independent and params/inits/force are all row-indexed, so a slice keeps them aligned. It
    re-draws the SDE noise in smaller blocks -- distributionally identical (still iid), not
    bit-reproducible against an unsplit run.

    BOUNDED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. Halving stops at _MIN_SIM_CHUNK (the same floor the predictive guard
    uses, so there is one number and one meaning), giving at most log2(batch/256)+1 widths. A NON-OOM
    failure re-raises on the first attempt with its traceback intact, so a genuine model blow-up cannot
    become a retry loop -- and a CUDA context that a sticky error has already killed costs a few fast
    failures rather than a hang.

    STAYS ON POWERS OF TWO for a power-of-two input, because the solver specializes on the batch
    dimension and every new width pays a fresh compile -- the same reason _max_sim_batch quantizes.
    Testing ``< 2 * _MIN_SIM_CHUNK`` rather than ``<= _MIN_SIM_CHUNK`` is what stops a
    non-power-of-two batch halving BELOW the floor.

    THE OUTER OF TWO RETRIES, AND DELIBERATELY THE EXPENSIVE ONE. _gen_obs_retry sits INSIDE fn and
    fires first, so by the time an OOM reaches here it is one the simulator-level split could not see:
    the reassembly buffer in gen_obs, the (rows, n_force_ch, t_fine) zero-drive tensor, the per-probe
    force rebuilt K times inside gen_chi_raw, the (rows, N_points) int64 gather index held across the
    whole K loop, x_spont_dim, gen_stats' sub-batches, pack_probe_block. At run_size=2048 /
    n_fine=280k those are ~2.29, ~2.29 x K, ~0.92 and ~0.46 GiB -- none of them inside _gen_obs_one,
    all of them linear in the rows. Halving the rows halves all of them at once. This is the gap that
    killed the 2026-08-11 retrain: a bare "CUDA error: out of memory" right after gen_chi_block's mask
    warning, i.e. inside the batch but outside the simulator.

    THE TRAINING BATCH IS THE RIGHT RETRY UNIT, and right in a way that lowering run_size is not. The
    batch's (t_scale_k, T_k) pair is an INDEX into the pre-filtered Sobol array, not a draw, and every
    row in the batch shares it -- as do the probe count, the multipliers and the durations, all drawn
    once above the seam. So re-running the batch as two half-width halves yields the SAME rows, in the
    SAME stratum, with the SAME probe set; the concatenation is the batch that would have been
    produced, differing only in that the SDE noise was drawn in smaller blocks (distributionally
    identical, not bit-reproducible -- the same licence _gen_obs_retry already takes). Shrinking
    run_size globally instead would change the NUMBER of (t_scale, T) strata in the run, which is a
    change to the training DISTRIBUTION rather than to its memory profile.

    THE FLOOR IS _MIN_SIM_CHUNK -- the same number the predictive guard and _gen_obs_retry use, so
    there is one number and one meaning.

    PREFER THE INNER RETRY. A halve here re-runs EVERYTHING for those rows: the spontaneous run, the
    summary statistics, and all K probe simulations -- about a dozen simulations plus a full gen_stats
    at K=11, against the inner retry's one. Do NOT lower _MIN_SIM_CHUNK to make this fire more often.

    NOT SHORT-CIRCUITED when the inner retry floored out, which is deliberate rather than an
    oversight: an inner OOM even at 256 rows can be caused entirely by memory held OUTSIDE the
    simulator (idx_c, x_spont_dim and the current probe's force are all live across the K loop), and
    halving the rows sheds all of it. So the outer halve genuinely can rescue what the inner could not.

    ``fn`` must be a pure function of its row range. It may read batch-level state, but it must not
    consume randomness anything OUTSIDE the batch depends on. _subset_probe_rows does draw from
    chi_gen inside fn -- harmless, because torch's CPU generator consumes one word per element, so
    rand(n) and two rand(n/2) leave the stream in the same position; only the within-batch pairing of
    draws to rows is re-permuted, which is a re-permutation of an iid draw.

    Generate synthetic training data for the SBI posterior using batch-by-scale strategy.

    Each batch shares a single (t_scale_k, T_k) pair sampled via Sobol sequence over the
    2D space [t_scale_lo, t_scale_hi] x [t_min_exp, t_max_exp]. Within a batch, the 11 ND
    parameters and (D, K_gs*D) vary per-simulation, but t_scale is overridden to the
    batch-level value. The pre-simulated ND trajectory is subsampled to dt_nd_k = dt_exp / t_scale_k
    and truncated to T_nd_k = T_k / t_scale_k points, so that after rescaling every simulation
    has physical duration T_k at sampling rate 1/dt_exp. Summary statistics are computed with
    the fixed dt_exp, and log(T_k) is appended to the conditioning vector.

    If theta_transform is provided, `prior` is interpreted as a LATENT prior. Samples z
    from it, applies theta_transform(z) to get physical θ for the simulator, and stores
    the latent z as the training target. The override of t_scale to the batch-level value
    is performed in physical space, after which the latent is recomputed via
    theta_transform.inv so the stored z corresponds exactly to what the simulator saw.

    If theta_transform is None, `prior` is physical and the legacy path is taken.

    :param model: Name of the simulation model (e.g. "nadrowski", "hopf").
    :param prior: Prior distribution over inferred parameters (ND x rescale product prior).
    :param forcing_prior: Prior distribution over dimensional forcing parameters, sampled
                          independently every batch regardless of SNPE round.
    :param t: Pre-simulated ND time tensor at finest resolution (dt_nd_min), shape (T_full,).
    :param run_size: Number of simulations per batch.
    :param n_runs: Number of batches to generate.
    :param steady_idx: Index where transient ends and steady-state begins (at full resolution).
    :param dt_nd_min: Finest ND time step of the pre-simulated trajectory.
    :param nd_dim: Number of ND model parameters; used to split inferred params into
                   theta_nd [:nd_dim] and theta_rescale [nd_dim:].
    :param forcing_idx: Maps forcing param names to column indices,
                        e.g. {"amp": 0, "freq": 1, "phase": 2, "offset": 3}.
    :param rescale_idx: Maps rescale param names to column indices,
                        e.g. {"t_scale": 3, "t_offset": 2, "f_scale": 7, "f_offset": 6}.
    :param dt_exp: Fixed experimental sampling interval (seconds).
    :param t_min_exp: Shortest experimental recording duration (seconds).
    :param t_max_exp: Longest experimental recording duration (seconds).
    :param t_scale_bounds: (lo, hi) bounds on the t_scale rescaling parameter.
    :param proposal: Proposal distribution for SNPE rounds 2+. If None, samples from prior.
    :param theta_transform: Optional transformation function for physical parameters.
    :param fixed_dict: Optional dict mapping ND parameter indices to fixed values for
                       conditional posterior estimation.
    :param state_dep_drift: Whether the model uses state-dependent drift.
    :param checkpoint: None (the default) disables checkpointing entirely -- no disk access, and the
                       function behaves exactly as it did before C-11, which is what keeps
                       analysis.gen_cal_data and every existing test call site unchanged. Otherwise a

                        the per-row subsetting. **For a STRATIFIED CALIBRATION, not for training** --
                        training's whole point is that K varies, and fixing it would train a network
                        that has only ever seen one probe count. A pooled SBC over a mixture of
                        counts can be flat while each count is miscalibrated in compensating
                        directions, which is why validating one count at a time needs a lever at all.
                        Placement stays jittered (``chi.sample_multipliers``) so only the count
                        differs from the training distribution. Note there is deliberately NO
                        ``chi_n_freqs`` here: that is the count an OBSERVATION supplies, and honouring
                        it during data generation would destroy the K-agnosticism the padded probe-set
                        layout exists to provide.
    :param chi_max_cycles: lock-in duration CEILING in drive cycles; None reads
                           ``config.CHI_MAX_CYCLES``. Bounds the ``duration_frac`` draw below --
                           without it the draw is a FRACTION of the recording, which does not bound
                           cycles at all, so a long recording walks its probes past the ~31-cycle
                           reproducibility wall (see config.CHI_MAX_CYCLES for the measurement).
    :param nd_idx: ND parameter name -> column. Required only when the box declares ``T`` instead
                   of ``f_scale`` (tier-1 physical consistency, core/SBI/derived.py); ignored
                   otherwise, so every pre-tier-1 caller is unaffected.
    :param k_b_cell: Boltzmann's constant in cell units (``SimConfig.k_b_cell``). Same condition.
    :param dtype: Tensor data type. Defaults to torch.float32.
    :param device: Computation device. Defaults to CPU.
    :return: Tuple of (training_data, thetas) where training_data has shape
             (n_runs * run_size, n_stats + n_forcing + 1) and thetas has shape
