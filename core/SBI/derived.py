"""Tier-1 physical consistency: f_scale derived from the gating-spring energy.

THE BUG THIS FIXES, AND IT IS A BUG RATHER THAN A NARROWING. The box samples the gating-spring energy
TWICE and never requires the two copies to agree:

  * once through the ND block, as ``N * beta`` (beta is the ND gating-spring energy in units of k_B T);
  * once through the rescale block, as ``f_scale * x_scale`` (a force scale times a length scale, i.e.
    an energy).

Their ratio IS an implied bath temperature, and nothing constrained it. Measured over the 10.24M rows
of the 2026-08-25 run, the implied T spans 14 / 80 / 286 / 939 / 6292 K at the 5/25/50/75/95th
percentiles -- the median is room temperature, so this is a VARIANCE problem, not a bias one -- and
only **2.27%** of rows land in 280-310 K. A multi-day training run spent ~97.7% of its budget on
configurations whose two copies of one energy disagree by orders of magnitude.

    f_scale = N * beta * k_B * T / x_scale

WHY f_scale AND NEVER beta. ``beta`` is a DRIFT parameter and the prior's stability screen operates on
the ND block alone. Deriving beta would make the ND block depend on the rescale block and contaminate
that screen -- every ND group would have to be re-swept. Deriving f_scale confines the change to the
3-D rescale block and leaves all ten ND groups sampled exactly as they are today. The
nondimensionalisation itself is untouched: T is not one of the four scales, ``NadrowskiModel`` never
sees it, and only the prior-sampling layer knows it exists.

HOW IT IS WIRED, and the shape was chosen to keep the prior a product of INDEPENDENTS. The inferred
parameter is ``T``, not ``f_scale``: the bounds file declares ``T in (lo, hi)`` in the column f_scale
used to occupy, so the prior keeps a proper 13-D density (making f_scale a deterministic function of
the other twelve would make that density singular, and SBC/TARP/NPE all need it non-degenerate).
``f_scale`` is then computed from theta at the one seam where theta is split into (nd, rescale) for
simulation, and it lands in the SAME COLUMN -- so every downstream reader of
``rescale_idx["f_scale"]`` is untouched.

⚠ TWO HAZARDS, both real:
  1. The derived f_scale reaches ~1e4 pN, and the chi drive amplitude is ``CHI_F0 * f_scale``. Any
     feasibility guard must read the DERIVED value. This is a real change to the training
     distribution, not a relabelling.
  2. T's posterior will be its prior, because the data says nothing on that axis. Its SBC histogram
     will be flat and VACUOUS. Report T as a fixed input, never as an inferred quantity, or you are
     quoting a credible interval on something you assumed.
