Every consumer -- orchestrator.build_posterior, the test suites --

them at its bottom, which also keeps monkeypatching ``pipeline.<name>`` effective. Calls back into

    WHY IT HAS TO BE CAPPED AT ALL. append_simulations calls it UNCONDITIONALLY on the full training
    tensor (sbi/inference/trainers/npe/npe_base.py:189). At the chi retrain's size -- 5000 x 2048 =
    10.24M rows x 114 columns float32, 4.35 GiB -- it runs ``torch.unique(x, dim=0)``, then builds
    ``zx = (x - x.mean(0)) / x.std(0)``, then runs ``torch.unique`` AGAIN. That is >= 13 GiB, and
    since unique over dim=0 is a lexicographic sort of 10.24M rows by 114 keys it is also minutes of
    single-threaded work. On a 16 GB card it is a guaranteed OOM at the END of a multi-day generation
    run -- the worst possible moment, because nothing is checkpointed. It fires on ANY successful run,
    chi or not, and no retry can help because it is one indivisible allocation.

    WHY CAPPING RATHER THAN DISABLING. In chi mode the check is inapplicable: train_nn sets
    ``z_score_x="none"`` whenever the embedding owns its standardization, and sbi's own warning text
    ends "if you have already set z_score_x=False, this warning will still be displayed, but you can
    ignore it." But spontaneous and forced modes DO train under ``z_score_x="independent"``, where a
    collapse under z-scoring is a real finding worth hearing about. It is also a PROPORTION test with
    a 10 % tolerance (``duplicate_tolerance``), so a 200k-row sample answers it to well within its own
    resolution. STRIDED, not a prefix: rows are grouped by batch and each batch shares one
    (t_scale, T) stratum, so ``x[:200_000]`` would sample ~98 of 5000 strata while ``x[::n]`` spans
    all of them.

    PATCHED BY REBINDING IN EVERY MODULE THAT HOLDS THE NAME, not just in sbiutils. npe_base does
    ``from sbi.utils import ... warn_if_zscoring_changes_data``, so its call resolves against
    npe_base's OWN globals -- patching sbi.utils.sbiutils alone changes nothing. Rather than hard-code
    that module path (sbi has already moved it once: sbi.inference.snpe -> sbi.inference.trainers.npe)
    this finds every module whose attribute IS the original function object. A few ms, once per round,
    and it cannot rot.

    SCOPED AND RESTORING, including on an exception: the patch is live only across append_simulations,
    so nothing else in the process -- another panel, a script that imported sbi, a later round -- ever
    sees a monkeypatched sbi.
