"""Resumable checkpointing for ``pipeline.gen_training_data``.

WHY. A production run is ``TRAINING_NUM_RUNS=5000`` batches x ``hw.batch_size=2048`` rows -- days of
simulation accumulating in host RAM with nothing on disk until it finishes. The 2026-08-10/11 OOM work
removed the failure modes that had actually bitten, but a driver reset, a reboot, a power cut or the
user closing the GUI window still cost the whole run.

THE INVARIANT THE WHOLE DESIGN RESTS ON:

    a checkpoint describes batches [0, k), with the RNG state captured at the TOP of iteration k,
    before that iteration has consumed any randomness.

Snapshot-and-restore, never replay: per-batch RNG consumption is NOT a fixed quantity. ``_gen_obs_retry``
and ``_rows_with_oom_retry`` re-draw SDE noise after an OOM and ``gen_obs``'s predictive split re-blocks
it, so how much randomness a batch consumes depends on what else the desktop was doing. Anything that
tries to fast-forward by counting draws is wrong on exactly the runs this exists to rescue.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT PERSISTED
  * ``pipeline._BUDGET_CAP_ELEMENTS`` / ``_budget_clean_runs``. Process-local by design: the right cap
    depends on what is on the card NOW, and a resumed run must re-learn it against the current desktop.
  * numpy's RNG state. ``np.random`` is used exactly once in this path, for ``inits`` before the loop
    (``torch.manual_seed`` does not touch numpy). The TENSOR is persisted instead, which is
    both smaller and immune to anything else in the process having drawn from numpy meanwhile.
  * The Sobol engine. ``SobolEngine(dimension=2, scramble=True)`` consumes the torch global RNG AT
    CONSTRUCTION, and ``_draw_and_filter``'s accept count depends on the geometry, so the schedule
    cannot be re-derived from a seed. The drawn arrays are persisted and the engine is never rebuilt.

LAYOUT.  ``<Artifacts>/simulations/<digest12>/``   (core.artifacts.store.KIND_DIRS["simulation"])
    manifest.json  the store's record: identity, parents, batches_done, complete, rows, wall time
    header.pt      write-once: identity + the (t_scale, T) schedule + inits + V + the bijection probe
    state.pt       rewritten atomically; its ``batches_done`` is THE COMMIT POINT
    state.prev.pt  one generation back, a few KB, for the case where state.pt is lost mid-write
    shards/x_<from>_<to>.pt, th_<from>_<to>.pt    write-once row blocks, never mutated after commit

The directory NAME is a digest of the declared identity, so "same config" resolves to the same place by
construction and two different configs can never share one. The digest is only a ROUTER: ``verify``
re-checks the header field by field and names the field that differs, so a hand-moved directory or a
hash collision produces a diagnosable message rather than "digest mismatch".

ORDERING, which is what makes a crash safe:
    1. write + fsync the shards for [prev, k)     (write-once names; a crash leaves orphans)
    2. copy state.pt -> state.prev.pt
    3. atomically replace state.pt with batches_done = k
Resume only ever loads shards covered by ``batches_done``, so orphans from step 1 are ignored. Shards
are durable before the state that references them, so no commit can point at data still in the page
cache.

Do not ``print()`` between steps 1 and 3 under the GUI: every write funnels through
``gui.streams._SignalStream.write``, which calls ``CancelToken.check()`` and would raise mid-commit.
