"""Summary statistics glue, split out of pipeline.py (which stays the public facade).

Consumers reach everything here as ``pipeline.gen_stats`` / ``gen_stats_features`` /
``winsorize_summary_block`` / ``count_pathological`` -- pipeline.py re-imports the names at its
bottom, which keeps monkeypatching ``pipeline.<name>`` effective (the kill-at test harness rebinds
``pipeline.gen_stats`` and gen_training_data's ``_rows`` reads it by bare name from that
namespace). Calls back into pipeline machinery go through the module object (``_pipeline.``) at

    WHY THIS EXISTS. One population of pathological simulations was silently damaging three

      * an EXACTLY CONSTANT trace makes `_group_d`'s `std.clamp(1e-12)` fire, so `z == 0`,
        `kurt == 0`, and D3_bimodality comes back as exactly 1/1e-12 -- a flatlined simulation, not
        an underflow;
      * a ~1e29-magnitude trace drags A1_mean's fitted std to 4.19e11, which is what made the
        channel invisible to the flow;
      * divergent draws erased the posterior-predictive PSD band entirely (torch.quantile
        propagates a single non-finite entry across the whole reduction, so one bad draw in a
        thousand blanked the figure).

    Three cheap reductions over tensors that are already resident, so this is the cheapest item in
    the conditioning-repair programme and should have existed from the start.

    Counted per SIMULATED trajectory, so an OOM retry that re-simulates a half-batch counts those
    rows twice -- the row denominator is accumulated the same way, so the FRACTION stays honest even
