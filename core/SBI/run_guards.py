    and verbatim the configuration of ``posterior_chi_08042026``, on record as
    "well-calibrated but uninformative ... 8 of its 10 probes measured noise". The values came from
    QSettings: ``inference_tabs`` seeds the chi widgets from ``config.CHI_*`` and then ``_restore``
    overwrites them from ``PRISM.ini``, so a value saved before the band changed was reapplied on
    every launch afterwards with nothing to say so. A persisted preference is the right behaviour;
    a persisted MEASUREMENT DEFINITION needs comparing against the module default before the spend.

    ``_assert_mode_matches`` already catches the same disagreement -- but only when a posterior is
    LOADED, i.e. after the days are spent. This fires before the first simulation.

    SCOPE IS DELIBERATELY NARROW. Only the band and the drive amplitude are checked, because only
    they shape the TRAINING distribution and are baked into the encoder's weights.
    ``chi_n_freqs`` is deliberately NOT an error: it is the count an OBSERVATION supplies, training
    draws K per batch so one posterior serves any count (see build_posterior's training_params, which
    omits it on purpose), and failing on it would refuse a perfectly good 7-recording experiment. It
    is reported alongside a real mismatch as context, never as the cause.
