    WHY THIS EXISTS. The PPC's "Invalid stats: 48/114" is alarming and unactionable -- it reads as

    all but a description of the experiment: 6 of 12 chi probe slots were never filled (the run
    supplied 6 probes into a network padded for 12), and 2 more were masked, leaving **4 live probes
    out of 12 slots**. That is a sentence you can act on -- it says the conditioning is mostly padding,
    which is a question about K and the probe planner, not about the estimator.

    A slot counts as DEAD when every one of its ``chi_elem_w`` elements has zero variance. Padded vs
    masked is not recoverable from variance alone (both are zeroed by the packer), so it is inferred

# === INFORMATIVENESS =============================================================================
# Every other diagnostic in this file measures CALIBRATION -- SBC, TARP, PPC coverage all ask whether
# the posterior's stated uncertainty is honest. None of them asks whether it is USEFUL, and a
# posterior that simply returns the prior passes all three perfectly. `posterior_08232026` is exactly
# that: SBC flat on all 13, TARP on the diagonal, and PPC coverage 99.1% at a nominal 90% because the
# intervals are far too wide.
#
# The scalar is the expected prior-to-posterior KL:
#
#     I = E_x[ KL( p(theta|x) || p(theta) ) ]   estimated as   mean over (theta*, x) pairs of
#         log q(theta* | x) - log p(theta*)
#
# drawn from the calibration set validate_calibration already simulates, so it costs no simulation.
#
# ⚠ IT IS NOT BOUNDED BELOW BY ZERO, AND A NEGATIVE VALUE IS A REAL READING RATHER THAN A BUG.
# E[log q - log p] >= 0 holds only when q IS the true posterior. A flow that is under-trained, or
# trained on a different distribution than the one being scored, assigns LOWER density to the truth
# than the prior does and the estimate goes negative. Measured -23.1 nats on a 5-epoch 40-row smoke
# train, which is the honest answer for that posterior: it is worse than the prior. So read the sign
# first -- negative means "this run learned nothing usable yet", not "the estimator is broken".
# The estimator is unbiased for the true posterior because (theta*, x) is drawn from the joint --
# the same property SBC relies on. It is in NATS: 0 means the data said nothing, and log(2) = 0.69
# means the posterior is on average half the prior's width in one direction.
#
# ⚠ WHY THE DECOMPOSITION IS SAMPLE-BASED WHILE THE TOTAL IS NOT. A normalising flow has no
# closed-form marginals, so per-parameter and per-direction figures cannot be read off log_prob. They
# are estimated from draws instead, which is noisier and is why the JOINT number is the one to quote.
#
# ⚠ AND THEY ARE AN ENTROPY REDUCTION, NOT A MARGINAL KL. `per_param[j]` is
# `H(prior_j) - E_x[H(posterior_j | x)]`, which measures how much NARROWER the marginal got. It is
# not KL(posterior_j || prior_j): a marginal that shifts without narrowing has positive KL and ZERO
# entropy reduction. That is the right quantity here on purpose -- the 2026-08-25 posterior's
# characterised failure is width
# (PPC coverage 99.1% at a nominal 90%, intervals 2-3x the observation's envelope) -- but do not
# quote it as a KL, and note it can go negative for a marginal the flow widened.
# The per-direction figures are computed in the flow's own LATENT coordinate, which under
# REPARAM_ROTATE *is* the Fisher eigenbasis -- so direction j here is column j of the V that
# `python -m core identifiability rotation` decomposes, and the two tables line up row for row.
