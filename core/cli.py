    Build a bounds-only SimConfig (no prompts) from a chosen model + bounds file. Ground-truth values,
    initial conditions, and T_obs are filled later (only for simulated inference). Shared by
    build_sim_config (CLI) and the GUI's SBI config form.

    The chi(omega) knobs are explicit keyword args so a GUI can set them PER CONFIG; each falls back to
    the live ``config.CHI_*`` module value when None (the CLI passes nothing and keeps its behaviour).
    They are stored ON the config, so a posterior trained from it is self-describing.

    ``units_override`` DECLARES what the numbers in the bounds/cell files mean; it never converts them.
    Pass a path to a units file, or an iterable of unit tokens (e.g. ``("nm", "ms", "pN", "kHz")``).
    None keeps the per-model default ``Resources/Units/<model>/units.txt``.

    ``bounds_dicts`` is the hand-entered alternative to ``bounds_file``: a
    ``(params, rescale, forcing)`` triple in ``parse_bounds_file``'s shape. Exactly one of the two must
    be given. Parameter ORDER within each dict is load-bearing (simulators bind columns positionally),
    so it is preserved verbatim.

    ``hw`` is the DeviceConfig to run on; None detects one. The GUI passes nothing and keeps
    detect_device(); the command-line tool builds it from --device. It is not a cosmetic setting --
    the device and dtype are part of the simulation identity (core/artifacts/identity.py:72-73).
