    opening frame and never a rate at all: measured 123 chars of stderr with no rate, against 670
    chars containing `14152.92it/s` with graphs off. The CLI was left watching a bar that never
    reports a speed. `miniters` gates refreshes as well and BOTH conditions must be met, but at
    max(1000, n // 100) it is not the binding one -- 1000 steps is ~14 ms at the graphed rate, far

    cache rather than letting it grow. At an out-of-memory up to that many pools are pinned, and the
    halving retry that follows is about to capture ANOTHER one: ``tuple(x0.shape)`` is part of
    _graph_key, so 2048 -> 1024 -> 512 -> 256 is four distinct keys. Dropping the cache is therefore
    the one release that acts on the retry's OWN next allocation rather than on the failed attempt's.

    THE DROP IS A REQUEST, NOT A GUARANTEE. Clearing the dict removes our reference; the pool comes
    back when the CUDAGraph object is actually collected, so an entry still pinned by a live
    traceback frame is freed later rather than now. That is one more reason a release belongs OUTSIDE
    an ``except`` block, where the failed attempt's frames have already been dropped.

    Recapture costs three warm-up passes of SOLVER_GRAPH_CHUNK steps plus one device synchronize --
    nothing against the batch that just failed, and only paid if the run continues.
