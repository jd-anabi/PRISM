# ── 6. TSNPE (truncated sequential NPE) ───────────────────────────────────────
class TSNPEPanel(_TrainingBudgetMixin, _StagePanel):
    """Tab 6. Refines the current posterior on ONE observation, without giving up the amortized one.

    ⚠⚠ WHAT THIS TAB MUST NOT BECOME. TSNPE proposes from the PRIOR RESTRICTED to an HPD region. It
    does NOT propose from the posterior. Fitting a density to the posterior and proposing from that
    gives ``p_L ∝ L^(L+1) q`` -- tempering -- and credible intervals then contract as
    ``(L+1)^(-1/2)`` with NO new information entering. SBC comes out flat anyway, because it validates
    the flow against the proposal it was trained on, so nothing on the Validate tab would catch it.
    The rule lives in ``core/SBI/truncate.py`` and is pinned by ``tests/test_conditioning_repair.py``.

    Gated on a posterior, the prior it was trained against, AND a persisted observation.
    An amortized posterior has no observation at SAVE time (``default_x`` is None on
    posterior_08232026), so the Infer tab records one at INFERENCE time and this tab keys on that.

    The budget group is the Posterior tab's, through ``_TrainingBudgetMixin``: a round is a simulation
    campaign, not a click, and the number belongs on screen before the button.

    Persists (group "inference_tsnpe"): the observation, the HPD level, the direction count and the
    two budget fields.
