"""Pick up PNGs that a runner saved to disk and show them in the panel's FigureStack.

WHY NOT just take them from the runner's return value: the FDT / Reduction / CrossVal runners don't
hand their figures back. run_fdt returns None, run_reduction_map returns a ReductionRecord, and
run_param_study_cli returns the two HDF5 *data* paths -- the figure paths are only print()ed
(core/FDT/fdt_pipeline.py:130-148, core/Reduction/sweep.py:192, core/FDT/cross_validation.py:284).

WHY NOT scrape those prints: four modules, four different formats, and it would weld the GUI to
print() text inside core.

So instead we snapshot the plot directory when a run starts and pick up whatever appears. That needs
no core change at all, and -- the real payoff -- it shows figures INCREMENTALLY: the FDT sanity plot
lands before the production sweep starts, and the S-sweep plot lands at the study's midpoint (which
core/FDT/cross_validation.py:283 saves early precisely so a long run shows you something). It also
still surfaces whatever a half-failed run managed to produce.

Runs entirely on the GUI thread (a QTimer). The worker is never involved.
