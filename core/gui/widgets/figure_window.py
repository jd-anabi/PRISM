"""Pop-out figure windows: a figure a stage produced, re-opened in its own top-level window where it
can be zoomed, panned and saved.

Two window types, one per figure source (see FigureStack):

  * InteractiveFigureWindow -- for SBI-panel figures that arrived as a pickled matplotlib Figure. The
    figure is UNPICKLED ON THE GUI THREAD and embedded in a live FigureCanvasQTAgg with matplotlib's
    navigation toolbar (zoom-rect / pan / home / save). This is the whole reason the sink ships the
    pickle: a figure BUILT on the worker thread must never be painted by a live canvas -- it deadlocks
    on matplotlib's global lock (gui_handoff.txt GOTCHA #2). A figure UNPICKLED here is a fresh
    main-thread object, so painting it is safe.

  * ImageZoomWindow -- for figures we only have as a PNG on disk (FDT / Reduction / CrossVal, whose
    runners save PNGs to disk rather than hand a Figure back), and as the fallback when a pickle is
    missing or fails to load. A QGraphicsView gives wheel-zoom, drag-pan and fit-to-window over the
    static image.

Both are parentless top-level windows. FigureStack holds the ONLY reference (a set) and drops it in
each window's closeEvent -- without that pin, Python/Qt would GC the window the moment show() returns
(the same lifetime trap BasePanel.dispatch handles for its workers).

    into the pickle and `pickle.loads` RE-REGISTERS the figure into the process-global pyplot registry

    the manager out from under a figure the user is currently viewing. So we snapshot Gcf around the
