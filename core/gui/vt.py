"""Route tqdm's terminal protocol into structured progress rows + clean log lines.

Qt-free on purpose: everything here is plain Python, so it can be unit-tested by replaying the
literal chunks tqdm writes (see tests/test_vt.py).

WHY THIS EXISTS
    The naive "split on \\r and \\n" reader that this replaces mistook tqdm's bar frames for log
    lines and appended one row per redraw. tqdm redraws a bar at pos>0 as THREE writes
    (tqdm/std.py:1493-1497 display(); :451-460 print_status; :1441-1443 moveto):

        write("\\n" * pos)                 # moveto(pos)
        write("\\r" + frame + padding)     # the bar itself
        write("\\x1b[A" * pos)             # moveto(-pos)     (colorama present => real ANSI)

    The third write has no terminator, so `frame + "\\x1b[A"` stranded in the reader's buffer and
    was flushed by the NEXT redraw's leading "\\n" -- through the newline branch, i.e. as a log line.

HOW WE CLASSIFY
    Every chunk tqdm writes is atomic and self-describing, so we classify per chunk, not by
    scanning for terminators. There is no cursor to track and therefore nothing to desync.

    The row index of a paint is NOT simply "newlines in the preceding chunk": moveto(+1) and
    close(leave=True)'s trailing fp_write('\\n') (std.py:1303) are byte-identical. The authority is
    the chunk that FOLLOWS the paint -- display() guards moveto(pos) and moveto(-pos) behind the
    same `if pos:`, so:

        a paint sits at row n  <=>  it is followed by a pure up-move of n     (else row 0)

    A paint preceded by no newline is therefore UNAMBIGUOUSLY row 0, and we publish it at once. A
    paint preceded by newlines is only a GUESS (real moveto, or a stale finalizer newline), so we
    hold it for exactly one chunk. That costs nothing when the guess is right: display() writes
    moveto / paint / moveto-back as three back-to-back writes, so the confirming up-move lands
    microseconds later. When the guess is wrong, the bar simply never appears on the wrong row.

INVARIANT -- DO NOT GIVE THE REDIRECTED STREAM A `fileno()` OR AN `encoding` ATTRIBUTE.
    Without them tqdm's screen-shape probe fails, so ncols is None (frames are never disp_trim'd,
    which `_PCT` relies on) and nrows is None (`pos < (nrows or 20)`, so every nested bar displays).
    Adding `encoding` also flips `ascii` (std.py:1038) and changes the frame glyphs.
