class SimulationError(RuntimeError):
    """A solver failure inside ``Simulator.simulate``, carrying the geometry that produced it.

    Always raised ``from`` the underlying error, so the original traceback survives as ``__cause__``
    and Python prints both. Callers that need to branch on the cause can test it directly, e.g.
    ``isinstance(err.__cause__, torch.OutOfMemoryError)``.

    This used to be ``print(...); exit()``, which hard-killed the interpreter: a CUDA OOM arrived with
    no traceback (so the failing call site was unknowable), and any caller -- the test runners, the
    GUI's QThreadPool worker, the scripts -- died mid-run with nothing reported. Note ``exit()`` is the
    ``site`` builtin and is not guaranteed to exist at all under ``python -O`` or an embedded
    interpreter.
