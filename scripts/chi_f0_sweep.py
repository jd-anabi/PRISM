⚠ BROKEN since piece 1 (2026-09-10): reads Resources/Posteriors; folded into the command-line tool in piece 2.

Gate the chi(omega) probe BAND and drive amplitude on the axes that actually vary in training:
probe frequency, drive amplitude F0, and -- since 2026-08-06 -- OBSERVATION LENGTH T_obs.

WHY. chi mode drives every probe at a fixed ND amplitude (config.CHI_F0) over a band of multipliers
of the measured Omega_0 (config.CHI_FREQ_BOUNDS). Three independent failure modes bracket those
choices:

  TOO SMALL F0  -> |chi| stops being REPRODUCIBLE. Same theta, different noise seed, different chi.
  TOO LARGE F0  -> the drive ENTRAINS the bundle. It abandons its own rhythm and follows the drive,
                   so chi reports the drive back to itself and the SHAPE information chi mode exists
                   to extract is gone.
  WRONG BAND    -> above ~0.25x Omega_0 |chi| is irreproducible at ANY amplitude or recording length
                   (measured 2026-08-05: high-multiplier CV does not fall from T_obs 5 s to 25 s, so
                   the variability is SYSTEMATIC, not statistical). At K=10 the retired (0.1, 10.0)
                   band put 8 of 10 probes there, which is what made posterior_chi_08042026
                   uninformative.

THE T_obs GATE. The band and F0 were settled on a
SINGLE T_obs = 5 s slice, but training draws T ~ logU[T_MIN_EXP_S, T_MAX_EXP_S] and |chi| is strongly
T-dependent -- 8.03 / 7.73 / 6.97 / 1.16 across T = 1 / 2 / 5 / 20 s at FIXED theta. A band chosen on
one slice of an axis the training distribution sweeps is not gated. So T is now the OUTER loop, and
every criterion below must hold at EVERY T, not on average.

Faithfulness: each sample is probed at ITS OWN measured Omega_0 via chi.peak_freq, exactly as
pipeline.gen_chi_raw does, so the CV reported here includes the estimator jitter the network actually
sees -- not an idealized fixed-frequency CV.

THE FOUR CRITERIA, per (T_obs, multiplier, F0):
  |chi| CV     reproducibility across noise seeds at fixed theta        (<= CV_MAX)
  phase sd     CIRCULAR scatter of arg(chi) across seeds, radians       (<= PHASE_MAX)
  SNR          mean|chi_driven| / mean|chi_undriven| at the SAME probe frequency. The denominator is
               the lock-in FLOOR: what the estimator returns on a passive trace, i.e. spontaneous
               1/f content plus noise leakage. Free -- it reuses the passive ensemble. This is the
               ratio nominated to eventually replace CHI_MIN_CYCLES, so it is reported
               beside the drive-cycle count the production resolution_filter currently gates on.
  own peak     entrainment: driven power at the UNDRIVEN Omega_0, over its undriven level (>= SUP_MIN)

Env knobs:
  M          ensemble size (independent noise realizations per point)   (default 24)
  TOBS_GRID  observation durations in SECONDS       (default: log-spaced over the REACHABLE range,
                                                     see the training-ceiling note printed at start)
  MULTS      probe multipliers of Omega_0           (default: log-spaced across config.CHI_FREQ_BOUNDS
                                                     plus ONE above-band control at 2x the high edge)
  F0S        ND drive amplitudes                    (default: just config.CHI_F0 -- the amplitude
                                                     window was settled on 2026-08-05, so a bare run
                                                     is the T_obs gate. Pass a list to re-open it.)
  SEED       RNG seed                                                   (default 0)
  CV_MAX     reproducibility ceiling on |chi| CV                        (default 0.20)
  PHASE_MAX  ceiling on circular phase scatter, radians                 (default 0.50)
             ⚠ the one screen here with NO empirical basis. It was chosen, so a verdict that turns
             on it (today: whether 0.3x belongs in the band) is not evidence -- see _edge_profile below
  SNR_MIN    floor on driven/undriven |chi|  -- PROPOSED, not settled   (default 3.0)
  SUP_MIN    entrainment floor: own peak must retain this fraction      (default 0.50)
  CYCLE_CAP  the prefix length shown in the per-point table and the plot. This is the control that
             tells a bad FREQUENCY from a bad DURATION                          (default 20)
  CYCLE_CAPS every prefix length to evaluate, for the WALL BRACKET. All of them run on the same
             traces, so this sweep costs lock-ins, not simulations -- never re-run the script per
             cap                                       (default 8 12 16 20 26 32 40 56, + CYCLE_CAP)
  PEAK_BW    half-bandwidth of the entrainment integral, as a fraction of Omega_0   (default 0.10)
  N_TOBS     points in the default T grid                               (default 5)
  N_MULTS    in-band points in the default multiplier grid              (default 4)
