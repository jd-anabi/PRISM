"""Shared setup for the diagnostic scripts in this folder.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Nine scripts each carried a copy of the same five-line ``SimConfig(...)`` literal,
built by hand from ``cli.parse_cell``. That literal hard-coded ``model="NADROWSKI"`` and
``state_dep_drift=True``, and -- the part that actually bit -- it set **no chi(omega) fields at all**.
``SimConfig.chi_mode`` is a plain ``= False`` default rather than a ``default_factory`` reading
``config.CHI_MODE``, and only ``cli.make_sim_config`` bridges the module constants onto a config. So
a hand-built config was PERMANENTLY non-chi, no matter what the global said, and every script
silently measured the single-frequency information set even when pointed at a chi run.

Routing through ``cli.make_sim_config`` + ``cli.load_and_validate_gt`` -- the pair the GUI's
``simulate_runner.build_stream_config`` already uses -- fixes chi, spontaneous configs, non-Nadrowski
models and user models in one move, and drops the deprecated ``si_factors`` argument from nine call
sites for free.

MODE DETECTION is three tiers, in strict precedence (see ``core.SBI.reparam.posterior_mode``):
  1. the posterior's ``.rot.pt`` sidecar (authoritative; always written since 2026-07-28),
  2. the trained network's own ``forcing_dim``,
  3. arithmetic on ``condition_shape`` (warns; breaks if the summary width ever changes).
Env knobs feed the CONFIG only. When a script also loads a posterior, the posterior VALIDATES the
config via :func:`require_mode`, which fails before the simulation spend rather than as a raw matrix
shape error thousands of simulations later.

Env knobs honoured here (each script documents its own on top of these):
  CELL      cell file path            (default Resources/Cells/nadrowski/master_spont.txt)
  BOUNDS    bounds file path          (default: the cell's sibling in Resources/Bounds/<model>/,
                                      else that model's shared master.txt)
  MODEL     override the model name   (default: derived from the cell's parent folder)
  TOBS_S    observation duration in SECONDS
  CHI       1/0 -- enable chi(omega) mode
  CHI_K     number of probe frequencies K
  CHI_F0    ND drive amplitude
  CHI_LO/CHI_HI   chi frequency bounds, as multiples of the measured Omega_0

⚠ CHI_F0 and CHI_LO/CHI_HI now require PRISM_CHI_OVERRIDE=1 for anything that reaches
``orchestrator.build_prior``/``build_posterior``. They set the BAND and DRIVE the network is trained
on, both baked into the encoder's weights, and a silent disagreement with ``config.CHI_*`` cost a
~5-day retrain once (Appendix A, 2026-08-19). Reading them is still free -- the guard fires only on
the two expensive entry points, so the measurement scripts that merely build a config are unaffected.
