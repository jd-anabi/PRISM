⚠ BROKEN since piece 1 (2026-09-10): reads Resources/Posteriors; folded into the command-line tool in piece 2.

Degeneracy / sloppiness map over ALL 16 inferred params.

Generalizes the archived diagnose_fmax.py Part B. At the cell-file ground truth it builds the
standardized feature-Jacobian

    J[j, p] = d<feature_j> / d(param_p)  /  noise_std_j

(CRN central differences of the ensemble-mean 41 features; noise_std_j = single-trajectory
feature std at GT). J is in signal-to-noise units -> an identifiability map. Then:
  - pairwise |cos| (degenerate pairs), SVD spectrum (sloppy directions), unique-handle frac.

ROBUSTNESS:
  - per-member validity filter (finite + |x| < adaptive CAP); features over valid members,
  - ONE-SIDED difference when a perturbation side destabilizes (kept, flagged); a column is
    'unmeasurable' only if BOTH sides destabilize,
  - t_scale handled correctly (its perturbation re-derives subsample / fine-grid length),
  - redimensionalization + features in float64 (so tiny offset perturbations don't underflow),
  - SVD / sloppiest-direction computed over STIFF columns (measurable, ||g|| > tol) so zero
    columns can't dominate.

Run:  TEE IT. Every table below is stdout-only except the .npz, and the [cfg]/[mode]/[noise]/probe
      banners plus the OOD warnings _common.enable_warnings() deliberately un-suppresses are NOT in
      the .npz. Use *>&1 (all streams), not 2>&1 -- PS 5.1 wraps a native exe's stderr lines in
      NativeCommandError records and sets $? false even on exit 0.

      & $py scripts/degeneracy_map.py *>&1 | Tee-Object Resources/Plots/degeneracy_forced_T4.5.log

Outputs are suffixed by MODE **and T_obs** -- both, because a map at another T_obs is another
measurement, not a redo (see MODE_TAG). Compare only equal-T runs.

Diff the two modes by LABEL, never by index -- forced has 41 feature rows and chi has 30+3K, so the
.npz arrays are not element-wise comparable:

      a = np.load("Resources/Plots/degeneracy_map_forced_T4.5.npz")
      b = np.load("Resources/Plots/degeneracy_map_chi_T4.5.npz")

# Runs BEFORE the dead-channel test because it feeds it: which probes are PINNED is arithmetic, and
# arithmetic sees a failure mode no statistic can (below).
#
# resolution_filter is OFF here -- mandatory, see the call site -- which means NOTHING masks a probe
# that saw less than CHI_MIN_CYCLES drive cycles. A sub-cycle lock-in returns the demeaned trace's
# residual drift: finite, in range, REPRODUCIBLE (healthy std, healthy-looking gradient) and not a
# susceptibility. No noise-based guard below can see it, because there is nothing anomalous about its
# statistics -- only about its physics. At the other end a probe over CHI_MAX_CYCLES has its segment
# truncated to exactly that many cycles, which PINS its `logcyc` to log(max_cycles) up to the floor()
# quantization of N_row -- see the pinning note in the dead-channel block for why that is worse than
# it sounds.
#
# BOTH edges cannot be cleared with margin at once, and that is arithmetic rather than a tuning
# failure: the band's dynamic range (hi/lo = 10 at the configured band) EQUALS the cycle window's
# (CHI_MAX_CYCLES/CHI_MIN_CYCLES = 10), so exactly one T_obs puts the low edge on the floor and the
# high edge on the ceiling simultaneously. chi.resolvable_multipliers records the same collision from
# the training side. Err ABOVE it: under the floor a probe is not a measurement AT ALL, whereas over
# the ceiling it is simply integrated over fewer cycles and comes back noisier.
#
# Since 2026-08-10 the ceiling is no longer a CORRECTNESS issue for this map, only a precision one.
# It used to pin `logcyc` to log(max_cycles) plus floor() quantization, which a 1e-9-floored fnoise
# amplified into the largest entry in the whole Jacobian (max|J| = 2.0e4 against 289 for the biggest
# real feature -- it set sigma[0] and a condition number of 56000 single-handedly). `logcyc` has since
# left CHI_FISHER_CHANNELS entirely, and the surviving channels -- log|chi|, cos, sin --
# are genuine measurements over a shorter window. So PINNED below is now INFORMATIONAL. Keep printing

# becomes whatever float32 rounding survived the central difference divided by whatever float32
# rounding survived the ensemble std, and that ratio is order 1 to 50: the magnitude of a real
# standardized feature. It then leads ||g||, the |cos| matrix, the SVD and the top-features table with
# nothing in the numbers to mark it as an artifact. This is not hypothetical -- it is what the `[:2]`
# unpack at the gen_chi_raw call below produced for four years' worth of K columns (`u`, magnitude
# ~3.5, ensemble std ~2.5e-8), and it is NOT specific to that bug: any channel the pipeline happens to
# pin arrives the same way.
#
# THE TEST IS RELATIVE, and that is the load-bearing choice. `1e-9` cannot be the criterion even
# though the clamp on the line above is 1e-9: `u`'s std is 2.5e-8, twenty-five times ABOVE the clamp,
# so an absolute test at the clamp would have missed the very bug that motivated this block. Against
# the channel's own magnitude, NOISE_EPS = 1e-6 is ~8 float32 ulps -- a spread that small is
# representation noise whatever the channel means.

# DROPPED, not fatal, and the pattern is ZERO_TOL's: that removes uninformative COLUMNS so they cannot
# dominate the SVD; this is the identical statement about ROWS. Fatal would be wrong -- the run costs
# hours and a benignly constant summary feature in one mode should not abort the comparison. Rows are
# ZEROED in J rather than deleted so every index still lines up with FEAT_LABELS: a zero row
# contributes nothing to a norm, a cosine, a singular value or an argsort, so no consumer below has to
# know this happened.
# This detector finds a channel pinned at float32 resolution -- `u` (ratio ~1e-8) is the worked
# example. It is kept as a STANDING guard rather than a fix for any current channel: after logcyc left the Fisher set
# no member of CHI_FISHER_CHANNELS pins, so on a healthy run it prints "no dead channels" and that
# line is the evidence, not decoration.
#
# It deliberately does NOT try to catch quantization-pinning, and the reason is worth keeping: the
# ceiling-pinned `logcyc` that used to sit here came in at ratio 2.7e-5, twenty-seven times ABOVE
# NOISE_EPS -- this gate passed it, and it still produced max|J| = 2.0e4 against 289 for the largest
# real feature. Raising NOISE_EPS until it caught would be threshold-guessing that starts eating
# quiet real features instead. That failure was fixed at the source by removing the channel, which is
# the right shape of fix: a statistic cannot separate quantization from a genuinely quiet feature, so
# do not ask it to.
