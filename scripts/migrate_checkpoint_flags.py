"""⚠ BROKEN since piece 1 (2026-09-10): reads Resources/Posteriors; folded into the command-line tool in piece 2.

Widen a pre-flag training checkpoint with the derived valid-flag block. One-shot, additive.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Section 11.3 item 1.2 adds a valid-flag channel beside each summary feature whose
value is a substituted sentinel. That is a change to the FEATURE SET, which normally means
re-simulating -- and the run behind `posterior_08232026` was 10.24M simulations over roughly five
days. It does not have to this time, because every flag is an exact equality test on a value the
checkpoint already stores (`_logp`'s sentinel is exactly log(1e-12); B7's no-secondary state is an
exact 0.0 in both of its columns). So the flags are DERIVABLE from the cache, and
`statistics.derive_valid_flags` is the same function the live pipeline calls -- the migrated rows are
bit-for-bit what a re-simulation would have produced for those columns.

WHY A NEW DIRECTORY RATHER THAN AN IN-PLACE EDIT. `summary_flags` is part of the checkpoint identity,
so the digest changes and this writes to a new directory. That is the design working, not an
inconvenience: a checkpoint stores conditioning ROWS, and a run whose summary block means something
different must never resume onto them. The source is left untouched, so an unmigrated re-run still
finds it and `posterior_08232026` remains reproducible.

WHAT IS COPIED VERBATIM, AND WHY IT MATTERS:
  * `V`, the Fisher rotation. Trap X10: its operating points come from an unseeded RNG, so a
    recomputed V would express the reused rows' LATENT targets in a different coordinate than the
    targets stored beside them. Copying it is a correctness requirement.
  * `probe`, the bijection probe. It pins the box the latent targets live in; the box is unchanged,
    so the stored probe stays valid and a later resume can still verify it.
  * the Sobol schedule (`batch_t_scales`, `batch_Ts`) and `inits`, neither of which is re-derivable
    (SobolEngine consumes the global RNG at construction; `inits` is drawn from NUMPY's, which torch seeds do not touch).

Env:
  SRC     source checkpoint directory. Default: the newest COMPLETE one that has no summary_flags.
  DRY     "1" to report what would happen and write nothing (default 0)
  ROWCHK  rows per shard to verify after writing (default 4096; 0 disables)
