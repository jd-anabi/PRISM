"""
The pre-flight run: all five pipeline stages end-to-end at tiny sizes, non-interactively.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The retrain runbook has called for "a smoke train before the long run" since the
retrain path was written, with no way to do one: `retrain_convergence.py` INHERITS its prior from an
existing posterior, and Resources/Posteriors/ is empty, so the very situation a smoke train is for --
about to spend days on the first posterior -- is the one situation that script cannot serve.

What this covers that the test suite does not: the suite pins contracts on stubs and tiny synthetic
inputs. This runs the REAL chain on the REAL bounds/cell files -- stability-screened prior build,
NPE training, SBC/TARP calibration, PPC and the eye test -- so plumbing that only appears when the
stages are wired together (mode widths, sidecar round-trip, the chi block's shape agreeing with the
network's input layer) fails here, in minutes, instead of hours into a multi-day run.

WHAT TO WATCH, beyond "it finished":

  * `chi: N/M probes masked` -- the count, not the presence. Some masking is by design (a probe under
    CHI_MIN_CYCLES on a short recording). The reference figure is ~37 % of TRAINING probes
    (36.8 % on the corrected band, reproduced at 36.7 % after the OOM work); materially above that
    means something in the chi path regressed.
      ⚠ THE RUN-LEVEL FIGURE IS NOISY, AND BY MUCH MORE THAN IT LOOKS. Do NOT treat "704 probes" as
      the sample size: all rows in a batch share one (t_scale, T) stratum AND one probe set, so the
      704 are 4 correlated strata and the EFFECTIVE n is the BATCH COUNT. Measured per-batch masked
      fractions span 13.5-57.3 % (SD 12.2 pp over 12 batches), so a 4-batch run has SD ~6.1 pp --
      not the ~1.8 pp a binomial on 704 would suggest. Observed run figures at the corrected band:
      31.7 / 32.7 / 34.8 / 35.4 / 36.7 / 38.2 / 44.9 %, mean ~36 %.
      So: compare the MEAN of a few runs against ~37 %, and treat a single run within roughly
      +/-12 pp as uninformative. SEED does not make runs comparable either -- it sets torch's RNG but
      not numpy's, and initial conditions come from np.random.randint.
      (2026-08-20: a 31.7 % reading was chased through a physics A/B before this was understood --
      Omega_0, which is what drives masking, was identical between solver paths at KS D = 0.0020
      against a 0.0347 critical value, n = 3072 per arm.) Note the PPC's fraction is much higher by design and
    is a readout of the POSTERIOR, not of the probe machinery -- do not read it as a bug.
      HISTORICAL, and no longer true: this bullet used to say the duration ceiling "is keyed on the
      batch's fastest f_peak, so a batch spanning a wide range of f_peak gives its slowest rows
      proportionally fewer cycles". That WAS the defect -- it is what drove the 77 % masking this
      script first found -- and the per-row fix removed it: the ceiling is now applied PER ROW ((B,) N_row) in
      gen_chi_raw. A scalar T_k anywhere in that path is now a regression.
  * out-of-distribution warnings from check_observation_in_distribution -- these are the guards that
    were invisible for months before _common.enable_warnings().
  * the mode banner. A width mismatch between the config and the trained net is exactly what this
    run exists to catch before the long one.
  * `[cfg] bounds=` AND `[cfg] rescale order=`, together -- see the BOUNDS warning below. The banner
    is the only place the difference shows.

⚠ PASS `BOUNDS` EXPLICITLY, or you smoke-test a different box than the retrain uses. The default cell
is `master_spont.txt`, and bounds resolution prefers a same-named SIBLING over the shared
`master.txt` (cli.resolve_bounds_for_cell, pinned by test_artifact_consistency) -- so the default
resolves `Bounds/nadrowski/master_spont.txt`, the 12-dim SPONTANEOUS box. Under CHI=1 that is not
loud: both boxes report `mode=chi` and both build the SAME 114-wide conditioning vector, because the
chi block is a function of CHI_K_PAD and not of the parameter set. What silently differs is the
inferred dimension -- 12 against 13 -- and the parameter dropped is `f_scale`, which is precisely the
retrain's headline hypothesis. A smoke run left at the
default therefore exercises a configuration that omits the thing the retrain exists to measure.
(A cross-LOAD between the two is caught, by the `param_keys` guard -- but nothing catches a smoke
train that simply runs the wrong one.)

This is a property of the CELL/BOUNDS pairing, not of this script, so it is not "fixed" here: the
sibling-first rule is shared with the CLI and the GUI and must stay that way.

This is NOT a calibration measurement. SBC at these sizes has no power -- CAL_N_SCALES is t_scale's
effective sample size (rows in a batch share its t_scale) and it is tiny here. A flat rank histogram from this run means
nothing at all; only a CRASH means anything.

Env knobs (CELL / BOUNDS / MODEL / TOBS_S / CHI* are handled by _common.script_cfg):
  NUM_RUNS   training batches                                  (default 4)
  RUN_SIZE   simulations per batch                             (default 32)
  N_CAL      calibration datasets for SBC/TARP                 (default 40)
  EPOCHS     max training epochs                               (default 5)
  SEED       RNG seed                                          (default 0)
  SAVE       "1" to NAME the prior/posterior artifacts this run writes (default 0)
             ⚠ NOT "nothing touches disk" -- every stage always WRITES its artifact into the store
             (CKPT_DIR, or the temp root); SAVE only decides whether the prior/posterior get a name
             (`smoke_prior` / `smoke_posterior`) instead of staying unnamed. The infer stage always
             writes an observation artifact regardless of SAVE: an amortized posterior has no
             observation at SAVE time, so recording one is the job of INFERENCE and is deliberately
             not skippable -- TSNPE keys on it. A temp-dir run discards all of it on exit; a
             CKPT_DIR run leaves it on disk -- delete the unnamed artifacts a smoke run leaves behind.
             ⚠ A SECOND SAVE=1 RUN AGAINST THE SAME CKPT_DIR IS REFUSED BY NAME: `smoke_prior` /
             `smoke_posterior` are already there, and every stage calls store.assert_name_free at its
             ENTRY now, so the refusal comes before the spend rather than after it. That is why run 2
             of the resume drill below leaves SAVE unset -- it loads the prior by name and its own
             posterior stays unnamed. A temp-dir run is unaffected: its store is new every time.
  STAGES     comma list to run a subset, e.g. "prior,posterior"
             (default prior,posterior,validate,infer)
  CHECKPOINT "1" to exercise the training-data checkpoint into a fresh temp dir (default 0;
             see the note at the rebinding below for why OFF is the default and why you should
             nonetheless run it ONCE on the GPU before a record run)
  CKPT_DIR   ROOT of the artifact store this run uses -- prior, simulation cache, posterior,
             observation, calibration and inference all go here -- instead of a fresh temp dir, so
             a SECOND run pointed at the same CKPT_DIR can find the first's prior and checkpoint and
             RESUME (default unset -> temp dir, never reused). Resuming the checkpoint requires
             PRIOR too; see below.
  PRIOR      name or id of a prior artifact in the store this run uses (CKPT_DIR) to LOAD instead
             of building a new one (default unset -> build). Also cuts ~9 min off a run. A loaded
             prior is never renamed, so this run names only a prior it actually built.

Run (chi mode, the case this was written for -- this is the RETRAIN's configuration, and the
`BOUNDS` is not optional; see the warning above):
  $env:CHI=1; $env:TOBS_S=4.5
  $env:BOUNDS="Resources/Bounds/nadrowski/master.txt"
  $env:CELL="Resources/Cells/nadrowski/master_spont.txt"
  & "C:\\Users\\J\\anaconda3\\envs\\biophys-env\\python.exe" scripts/smoke_train.py

Once on the GPU before a record run, add `$env:CHECKPOINT=1` (exercises the checkpoint on the card, which no
CPU test can) and `$env:SAVE=1` (exercises the artifact writes; delete the `smoke_*` artifacts after).

THE RESUME DRILL -- run 1 BUILDS and SAVES a prior into CKPT_DIR (naming it `smoke_prior`); run 2
LOADS that prior by name and so RESUMES the checkpoint (CKPT_DIR without a matching PRIOR is a
silent no-op -- see the warning at the rebinding below):

  # run 1
  $env:CHECKPOINT=1; $env:CKPT_DIR="<scratch>/ckpt"; $env:SAVE=1
  $env:NUM_RUNS=2; $env:STAGES="prior,posterior"        # + the chi/BOUNDS/CELL block above
  & "C:\\Users\\J\\anaconda3\\envs\\biophys-env\\python.exe" scripts/smoke_train.py

  # run 2 -- same CKPT_DIR, now with PRIOR set to what run 1 named, and SAVE CLEARED: the names run
  # 1 wrote are taken, and every stage refuses a taken name at its entry
  $env:CHECKPOINT=1; $env:CKPT_DIR="<scratch>/ckpt"; $env:PRIOR="smoke_prior"; $env:SAVE=""
  $env:NUM_RUNS=2; $env:STAGES="prior,posterior"        # + the chi/BOUNDS/CELL block above
  & "C:\\Users\\J\\anaconda3\\envs\\biophys-env\\python.exe" scripts/smoke_train.py

Run 2 must print `Reusing the Fisher rotation stored with the training checkpoint` and finish in a
fraction of run 1's time. That is the ONLY way to execute orchestrator.py's CPU->CUDA rehoming of the
stored `V`, which is guarded by `if ckpt_resumed is not None and rotate:` and therefore runs on a
GPU RESUME WITH ROTATION and nowhere else -- i.e. precisely the run checkpointing exists to rescue, and a path
no CPU test can certify. Delete CKPT_DIR afterwards; it must not be somewhere a real run finds it.
