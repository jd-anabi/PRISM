What did a SAVED posterior actually measure? Reads the artifacts; simulates nothing.

Answers the question a corner plot cannot: a 13-D posterior with four well-constrained directions and
nine prior-like ones looks like "severe degeneracy" on the physical axes, but it is a perfectly good
result as long as you can say WHICH four. The Fisher rotation V in the posterior's `.rot.pt` sidecar
is exactly that basis -- its columns are the eigenvectors of the prior-averaged simulation Fisher
F = J^T J, sorted descending by eigenvalue -- so the decomposition is already on disk and free.

NOT the same thing as scripts/identifiability_offgt.py, which SIMULATES a Laplace metric at K prior
points to ask whether the information exists at all. This one asks what a particular trained artifact
kept, costs no simulation, and runs in a second.

WHAT IT REVEALED ON THE 2026-08-25 RETRAIN, and why the distinction matters: `k` puts 99.9% of its
weight on a single direction whose loading is -1.00*k, and its overlap with `x_scale` across all 13
directions is 0.0002. The central problem had been recorded as the `k`~`x_scale` alias
(|cos| 0.97, measured three times). Both are true, and together they say something sharper than
either: degeneracy_map's |cos| compares the two parameters' gradient DIRECTIONS, while a Fisher
eigenvalue is about gradient MAGNITUDE, and `k`'s gradient is both nearly parallel to `x_scale`'s and
tiny. So `k` is not so much degenerate as UNMEASURED -- and you cannot rotate, reparameterise or
re-prior your way out of a flat direction, which is a different engineering problem from breaking an
alias.

Env:
  POST   path to the posterior .pt (the .rot.pt sidecar is read from beside it), or a bare name
         resolved against Resources/Posteriors. Default: the newest .pt in Resources/Posteriors.
  NBOT   how many of the worst directions to total in the per-parameter table (default 3)
  TOPN   loadings shown per direction (default 4)
