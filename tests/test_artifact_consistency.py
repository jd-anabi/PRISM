"""Artifact-identity tests: the master Bounds/Cells triple, and the guards that stop a prior or a
posterior being used against a configuration it does not belong to.

WHAT THESE LOCK DOWN
    A posterior is only meaningful against the exact (model, parameter set + ORDER, box) it was
    trained in -- the flow learns a density over the LATENT coordinate, so the box is what turns its
    output back into physical values. None of that used to be checked. `build_prior` validated
    NOTHING on its load path, `build_posterior` checked only the log-mask, `_assert_mode_matches`
    checked only the observation mode and the conditioning WIDTH, and `load_eval_bijection` rebuilt
    the box from whatever config happened to be loaded rather than from the posterior.

    The cost of that was paid once already: a chi posterior trained on one cell's bounds could be
    loaded, validated and inferred against another's, with every reported parameter silently decoded
    through the wrong box edges, and the only way to establish what had actually happened was to
    compare GMM component counts against the prior files on disk after the fact.

    Also pinned here: the master Bounds/Cells triple that replaced the five per-cell boxes. Its whole
    point is that ONE box serves every cell, so "the two bounds files agree" and "every cell sits
    strictly inside" are invariants, not incidental facts.
