"""Progress-rendering regression tests for the GUI.

THE BUG THESE LOCK DOWN
    tqdm redraws a bar at pos>0 as three writes -- '\\n'*pos, then '\\r'+frame, then '\\x1b[A'*pos
    (tqdm/std.py:1493-1497). The old stream reader split on terminators, so the frame (which is never
    terminated) stranded in its buffer and was flushed by the NEXT redraw's leading '\\n' -- i.e. as a
    LOG LINE. Every nested-bar redraw appended one row, so a training run buried the log pane under
    hundreds of bar snapshots.

    The pipeline nests bars four deep (core/SBI/pipeline.py:517 -> :371 ->
    core/Simulator/simulator.py:50 -> core/Solvers/sdeint.py:15), so this fired constantly.
